This repo holds a pre-rendered Loudspeaker Explorer notebook with some example
settings for demonstration purposes.

You are most likely looking for the [main Loudspeaker Explorer repo](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer). Hopefully this repo is in sync with the main one.

**Do not send patches against this repo.** Rendered Loudspeaker Explorer
notebooks contain a lot of data, making merging impractical. Use the [main repo](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer) instead.
