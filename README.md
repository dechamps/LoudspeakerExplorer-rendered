This repo holds a pre-rendered Loudspeaker Explorer notebook with some example
settings for demonstration purposes, optimized for viewing and running in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer-rendered/blob/master/Loudspeaker_Explorer.ipynb). "Official" links to the Loudspeaker Explorer lead to this notebook.

**If you came here you are most likely looking for the [main Loudspeaker Explorer repo](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer).** This repository is automatically kept in sync with the main one using a [Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22).

**Do not send patches against this repo.** The rendered notebook uses a very different format from the source notebook, making merging impractical. Feel free to send pull requests against the [main repo](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer/pulls).
