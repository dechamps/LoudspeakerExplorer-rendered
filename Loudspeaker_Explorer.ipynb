        "\n",
        "To run the code and (re)generate the data, go to the **Runtime** menu and click **Run all** (CTRL+F9). **You will need to repeat this every time you change any of the settings or code** (e.g. if you enable or disable speakers).\n",
        "\n",
        "**All the charts are interactive.** Use the mousewheel to zoom, and drag & drop to pan. Click on a legend entry to highlight a single response; hold shift to highlight multiple responses. Double-click to reset the view. (PROTIP: to quickly switch back and forth between speakers, select the speaker dropdown, then use the left-right arrow keys on your keyboard.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Charts can take a few seconds to load when scrolling**, especially if you're using the notebook for the first time. Be patient.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Charts will not be generated if the section they're under is folded while the notebook is running.** To manually load a chart after running the notebook, click on the square to the left of the *Show Code* button. Or simply use *Run all* again after unfolding the section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Other ways to run this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't have a Google account, or don't want to use Colab for any other reason, the following alternatives are available:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer/master?filepath=Loudspeaker_Explorer.ipynb)**: similar to Colab. Can take a (very) long time to load the first time; be patient. To run the notebook after it's loaded, go to the **Kernel** menu and click **Restart & Run All**.\n",
        "- **[Run locally](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer#developer-information)**: clone the Github repository and follow the developer instructions to run the Notebook on your local machine. This is not an easy option as it requires you to set up a Python environment. This is useful if you want maximum performance, if you want to make significant changes to the code, or if you want to contribute to Loudspeaker Explorer.\n",

        "**CAUTION: interpreting SM is very tricky and fraught with peril.** The Olive paper describes SM as the \"smoothness\" of the response, which is misleading at best. The real meaning of SM as mathematically defined in the paper is way more subtle and hard to describe. In reality, SM describes how much of the curve deviation from a flat, *horizontal* line can be explained by the overall slope (as opposed to just jagginess). This leads to some counter-intuitive results - for example, a roughly horizontal curve with negligible deviations can have an SM of zero!

        "LFX is discussed in section 3.2.4 of the [paper](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=12847) and section 0078 of the [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050195982A1). Loudspeaker Explorer uses the following formula:\n",

        "\n",
        " - $\\mathrm{LFX}$ is the low frequency extension in $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{Hz}$. Bring $10$ to the power of $\\mathrm{LFX}$ to get the cutoff frequency in Hz.\n",
        " - $x_i$ is the frequency of the $i$th measurement point (in increasing frequency order).\n",
        " - $SP_i$ is the sound pressure of the Sound Power curve in dB at the $i$th measurement point.\n",
        " - $\\overline{LW}$ is the mean sound pressure of the Listening Window curve in dB between 300 Hz and 10 kHz.\n",
        " \n",
        "In plain English, given the first measurement point whose Sound Power is above the -6 dB point (based on the Listening Window average between 300 and 10 kHz), LFX is the logarithm base 10 of the frequency of the previous measurement point.\n",

        "For some debate on the definition of this metric, see [this](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/speaker-equivalent-sinad-discussion.10818/page-7#post-306831), [this](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/speaker-equivalent-sinad-discussion.10818/page-8#post-307638) and [this](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/speaker-equivalent-sinad-discussion.10818/page-9#post-308320). Note that the Loudspeaker Explorer formula differs somewhat from the original formula in the paper. This is because the formula in the paper did not seem to anticipate pathological Sound Power curves like the [Ocean Way Audio HR5](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/ocean-way-hr5-studio-monitor-review.13925/#post-424729) that dip below the -6 dB point multiple times below 300 Hz. The \"improved\" formula Loudspeaker Explorer uses returns a more sensible result for such speakers, but still returns the same result as the original formula for \"well-behaved\" Sound Power curves."
