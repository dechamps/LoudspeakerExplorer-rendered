        "Welcome to the [Loudspeaker Explorer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer-rendered/blob/master/Loudspeaker_Explorer.ipynb), a speaker measurement visualization, analysis and comparison tool. This is an interactive [Colaboratory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",

        "\n",
        "To run the code and (re)generate the data, go to the **Runtime** menu and click **Run all** (CTRL+F9). **You will need to repeat this every time you change any of the settings or code** (e.g. if you enable or disable speakers).\n",
        "\n",
        "**All the charts are interactive.** Use the mousewheel to zoom, and drag & drop to pan. Click on a legend entry to highlight a single response; hold shift to highlight multiple responses. Double-click to reset the view. (PROTIP: to quickly switch back and forth between speakers, select the speaker dropdown, then use the left-right arrow keys on your keyboard.)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Charts can take a few seconds to load when scrolling**, especially if you're using the notebook for the first time. Be patient.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Charts will not be generated if the section they're under is folded while the notebook is running.** To manually load a chart after running the notebook, click on the square to the left of the *Show Code* button. Or simply use *Run all* again after unfolding the section.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Other ways to run this notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't have a Google account, or don't want to use Colab for any other reason, the following alternatives are available:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **[Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer/master?filepath=Loudspeaker_Explorer.ipynb)**: similar to Colab. Can take a (very) long time to load the first time; be patient. To run the notebook after it's loaded, go to the **Kernel** menu and click **Restart & Run All**.\n",
        "- **[Run locally](https://github.com/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer#developer-information)**: clone the Github repository and follow the developer instructions to run the Notebook on your local machine. This is not an easy option as it requires you to set up a Python environment. This is useful if you want maximum performance, if you want to make significant changes to the code, or if you want to contribute to Loudspeaker Explorer.\n",

        "**Note:** CTA-2034-A is actually ambiguous as to the definition of this curve - the text could also be interpreted to refer to the average of the *individual responses* from all the angles that make up the aforementioned curves. A clearer definition can be found in the [seminal paper](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=11234) the standard is based on, which does define the Early Reflections curve as an average of averages, and this was [confirmed by Todd Welti](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/spinorama-also-known-as-cta-cea-2034-but-that-sounds-dull-apparently.10862/page-3#post-343970) who worked with the author of the paper. **Sadly, Klippel uses the wrong definition (average of individual responses), and for that reason, the data shown here is slightly wrong.** For details, see [this](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/spinorama-also-known-as-cta-cea-2034-but-that-sounds-dull-apparently.10862/page-2#post-323270), [this](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/master-preference-ratings-for-loudspeakers.11091/page-16#post-395073), and [this](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/master-preference-ratings-for-loudspeakers.11091/page-18#post-397135)."

        "**CAUTION: interpreting SM is very tricky and fraught with peril.** The Olive paper describes SM as the \"smoothness\" of the response, which is misleading at best. The real meaning of SM as mathematically defined in the paper is way more subtle and hard to describe. In reality, SM describes how much of the curve deviation from a flat, *horizontal* line can be explained by the overall slope (as opposed to just jagginess). This leads to some counter-intuitive results - for example, a roughly horizontal curve with negligible deviations can have an SM of zero!
